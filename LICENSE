Your license permits any LBTH borough officer access to the data; the proposed approach [LBTH Sharepoint site] is acceptable. I’d ask that you please keep a log of officers/groups that have access to the internal sharepoint folder in case we need to request it for audit purposes, and ensure it is only accessible to LBTH staff. The GLA would need to administer a separate license directly to consultants/contractors.
According to our license terms, we do not need everyone to sign-up to the HSDS. In general it is our preference to have one main point of contact within a borough coordinating data deliver and feedback internally – so I support the approach you’re taking here. The only drawback is that if the other users within LBTH do not go through our onboarding process, they will not receive regular communications/updates from the programme, and they will not have access to the training resources on Basecamp, or the bespoke analyses that are published on the Datastore.
